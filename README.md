# Fegaria-Remastered

 Similar to my other project Fegaria, but with improved graphics, collisions and terrain generation. 

## Required modules: pygame, sys, math, time, os, random, pickle, datetime

## Notes:
- You can turn off and on settings in the CONFIG.txt file
- Includes tutorial world, full controls in CONTROLS.txt
- Changes listed in changelog.txt
- Music and sounds from Terraria, not my own.
