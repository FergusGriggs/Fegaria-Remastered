# Fegaria-Remastered

![alt text](https://github.com/FergusGriggs/Fegaria-Remastered/blob/master/Screenshots/screenshot11.png)

 Similar to my other project Fegaria, but with improved graphics, collisions and terrain generation. 

## Installation
I've only used modules that are installed when python 3.6.4 
is installed (with the exception of pygame), so all you have to do is run the 'fegaria remastered.py'
file to play the game.
### Required modules (pre installed): 
- pygame
- sys
- math
- time
- os
- random
- pickle
- datetime

## Notes:
- You can turn off and on settings in the CONFIG.txt file
- Includes tutorial world, full controls in CONTROLS.txt
- Changes listed in changelog.txt
- Music and sounds from Terraria, not my own.
